To enable switch behavior, we need to specify *trigger* *target* relationship. 

There might be many triggers corresponding with one target, which will collectively decide the on/off state of the corresponding target in two types of logical conditions: *AND* and *OR*.

  * *AND* The target will be turned on if and only if all of the corresponding triggers are turned on.

  * *OR* The target will be turned on when any of the triggers is turned on.

== Define a target and its triggers ==
To specify a target, add css class 'target' to any of the html element you prefer to be as the target, then add 'rule' attribute to the element, write a relationship definition in the form of:

_definition_: _logic_"["_css_selectors_"]"

_logic_: "and" | "or"

_css_selectors_ : css_selector | css_selector"|"_css_selectors_

The css_selector are just any kind of legal css selectors to locate a trigger. So a sample is like the following:

{{{
<input name="foo" type="radio" class="switch-a" id="switcha" />A Switch <br/>
<input name="foo" type="radio" class="switch-b" id="switchb"  />B Switch <br/>	
<div id="casea" class="target" rule="or[#switcha|#switchb]">This is A state</div>
}}}
