#Central Event Mechanism Specification

= Introduction =

Central Event System provides a mechanism to register and implement hooks across the whole WForms library. 

It provides a flexible way to enable multiple hook responders to a same event. Besides, a neutral event registry avoid the interdependency of registering event responders from one module to another, because an unpredictable loading sequence of modules will make it very hard to implement.
